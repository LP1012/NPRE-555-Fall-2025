\begin{foreword}
  The purpose of this document is to contain the lecture notes given in NPRE 555: Reactor Theory I.
  It has been created by the students of this course on an ongoing basis throughout the semester.
  These notes are not intended to take the place of a true course on neutron transport.
  However, the hope is that this document will serve as a reference for those starting out or are otherwise familiar with the topic.
