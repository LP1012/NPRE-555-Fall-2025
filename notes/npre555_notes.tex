\begin{foreword}
  The purpose of this document is to contain the lecture notes given in NPRE 555: Reactor Theory I.
  It has been created by the students of this course on an ongoing basis throughout the semester.
  These notes are not intended to take the place of a true course on neutron transport.
  However, the hope is that this document will serve as a reference for those starting out or are otherwise familiar with the topic.
  These notes were created by Dr. Huff using her own experience and from references~\cite{bellNuclear_reactor_theory_bell_glasstone1970,duderstadtTransportTheory1979,lewisComputationalMethodsNeutron1993,staceyNuclearReactorPhysics2007}.
