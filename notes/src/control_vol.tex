Consider a volume $V$ with surface $S$.
To determine the rate of change of $n(\rvec,\omhat,E,t)$, what phenomena must we consider?
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Collisions (ex. absorption, elastic/inelastic scatter)
  \item Streaming (moving in and out of the volume through the surface)
  \item Sources
\end{enumerate}
